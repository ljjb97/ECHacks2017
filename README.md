Project created at Electric city hacks 2017

This program tries to use data in the two given csv files to attempt to train a machine learning algorithm to be able to predict how many yards it thinks will be produced on each play. 

The diffrent methods the we've tried can be seen at the bottom the python file. Accuracy for these tests is indicated by the result from the root mean squre. The lower this number is the more accurate the predictions are.
